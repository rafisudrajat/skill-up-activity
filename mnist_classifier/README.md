# A project to compare models created using mlx library vs pytorch using mps backend

In this project I created a simple [MNIST digit classifier dataset](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) using convolutional neural network.

I compared two same models, one created using MLX library and the other using pytorch with mps backend to see the performance of both library when used in apple silicon chip.
