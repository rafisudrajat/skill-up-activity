# A project to implement auto encoder based recommender system

In this project I implemented auto-encoder algorithm for recommender system and train it using [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

Original paper that explain auto-encoder based algorith for recommender system can be seen in [here](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~akmenon/papers/autorec/autorec-paper.pdf)
